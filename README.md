Implemented a smart contract template called "Cash" using DAML for currency exchange. The contract facilitates the issuance, transfer, and exchange of currency between parties. Responsibilities included defining data types for amount, currency, issuer, holder, and exchange rate; specifying roles for parties (issuer, holder, and exchange); ensuring the amount of cash is larger than zero; implementing functions for transferring cash to a new holder, updating the exchange rate, and swapping currencies; and conducting scenario testing to validate contract functionality, including issuance, transfer, exchange rate update, and currency swapping.
